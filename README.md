# Shopify Frontend developer Code Challenge - Vít Horáček

I have decided to use Next.js and their provided [TailwindCSS starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss)

I have around half year of experience with making Next.js applications as a freelancer, I have really come to love the integration they provide with Vercel and the ease of use of this tech stack. I recommned anyone to try it out just because of its great Developer Experience.

For most of the styling, I have chosen TailwindCSS 2.0. I have used this solution in couple of my previous projects and it was the most convenient solution for styles I have come across yet. It is unopiniated yet it is mostly written dierctly in the js/jsx files so I do not have to switch between SCSS files of CSS modules. At the same time, it is easy to add more complex animations or solutions required by the project.

For fetching from the API, I will use SWR library together with Axios library which I believe makes this rehydration very straightforward.
